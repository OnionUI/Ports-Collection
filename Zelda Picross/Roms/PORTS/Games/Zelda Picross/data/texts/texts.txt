The insane desire of Ganon for the Triforce changes the Kingdom into picross grids.
The weird curse changes the landscape, slicing the Kingdom in squares.
Faced with the squared land, Link storms out to defeat Ganon and to save his princess.
After the lengthy quest, the Hero of Hyrule again fulfilled his destiny. Link solved all the Picross, defeated Ganon, recovered the Triforce and saved the Princess. **The Realm, freed from the curse, returns to it original form and peace reigned again. **Meanwhile, our Hero hopes Ganon will return to bring back some life to the too peaceful Kingdom of Hyrule.
